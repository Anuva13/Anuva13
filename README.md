ðŸ’¼ Experienced Scrum Master | ðŸ’» Aspiring Coder & Technologist

** Hi there! I'm a seasoned Scrum Master with a proven track record of leading cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutionsâ€”on time and within budget. With years of experience fostering collaboration, agility, and continuous improvement, I thrive on helping teams succeed.

Now, I'm diving into the world of codeâ€”learning, building, and experimenting as I grow into a hands-on technologist. This space is where I share my journey, projects, and learnings as I go from agile coach to code contributor.

ðŸš€ Always curious. Forever learning.
ðŸ”§ Currently working on Python packages and unit-tested software tools.
ðŸ“š Open to collaboration and knowledge sharing!
